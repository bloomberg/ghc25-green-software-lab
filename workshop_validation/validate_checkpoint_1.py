Workshop Part 1A Validation Test
Tests that fax-service has been removed from deployment.yaml

IMPORTANT: This test is DESIGNED TO FAIL initially and should pass after
attendees remove fax-service from deployment.yaml

Usage:
    python3 workshop_validation/validate_checkpoint_1.py

Expected Behavior:
- At workshop start: FAILS (fax-service present)
- After Checkpoint 1 completion: PASSES (fax-service removed)
